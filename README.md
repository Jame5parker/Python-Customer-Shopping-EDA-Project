# 🛒 Customer Insights Analysis (Instacart Market Basket Project)

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project analyses customer purchasing behavior using the **Instacart Market Basket Analysis** dataset from Kaggle.  
It demonstrates my ability to perform **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **customer segmentation** to uncover meaningful insights about shopping patterns and customer loyalty.

The goal is to showcase how analytical thinking and visualisation can turn large-scale transactional data into clear, actionable insights for business growth and marketing strategy.

## 📊 Project Overview
The dataset contains millions of grocery orders from over 200,000 Instacart users, including details on products, departments, order timing, and customer behavior.  
This analysis explores:
- Customer purchase frequency  
- Product affinity and reorder behavior  
- Basket composition and popular product categories  
- Insights into customer segmentation and loyalty patterns
- Insights into aisle and product performance for stock streamlining

### Key Objectives
- Understand **customer buying habits** and reorder trends  
- Identify **top-performing products and categories**  
- Analyse **order frequency, recency, and repeat behavior**  
- Segment customers based on shopping patterns and value
- Evaluate **aisle and product performance** based on sales and stability

## 💬 About Me
I am an individual looking to transition into data analysis through a strong passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions.
My work focuses on uncovering trends, optimising performance, and creating clear visual stories that connect data to real-world impact.
I enjoy exploring data across domains — from business operations and customer behavior to marketing performance and financial trends.
I’m experienced with tools such as Excel, SQL, and Python, and I’m comfortable handling end-to-end analytics workflows: data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualisation.
As I continue to develop I am expanding my learning into new analytical techniques (machine learning and AI), experimenting with visualisation tools, or studying real-world business cases to better understand how data informs decision-making.
